## Why

If you're interested in historical baseball data going back to the 19th century, you need to use the phenomenal recontructed dataset from [the Retrosheet project](https://www.retrosheet.org).

Here is the license for their data:

I have two particular interests in working with this data in julia:

- exploring the data with julia's excellent libraries for machine learning and data visualization, in its unique Pluto notebook environment
- play-by-play "replay" of historical games
